A simple Qt-based 2D game engine.

========
1. Build
========

1.1) Dependencies

* Qt5
	https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt5

* Box2D >= 2.2.1
	http://box2d.org

We strongly recommend you to install Qt5 to a different prefix from Qt4.
If you have Qt4 installed at /usr, we suggest one of the following prefixes:

* /opt/Qt5
* /usr/local/Qt5

1.2) Building

Available QMake parameters:

* QT5PATH (Optional)
	Prefix where Qt5 has been installed. It is required to install
	Quasi's QML import plugin and related files.

* BOX2DPATH (Optional)
	Path to Box2D installation. If your Linux distro packaging system
	provides the required version, it is recommended to use it to install
	the library and devel files.

* BUILD_EXAMPLES (Optional)
	Use BUILD_EXAMPLES=1 to build usage examples.

Sample build from Quasi's root source tree (shadow build not supported yet):

$ qmake QT5PATH=/opt/Qt5 BOX2DPATH=/usr BUILD_EXAMPLES=1
$ make
$ sudo make install


===========
2. Examples
===========

If you have installed the QML plugin to the proper Qt5 import directory,
you can run the examples directly from their specific build directories.

Example:

$ cd $(QUASI_SOURCE_TREE)/examples/box2dpolygon_circle/
$ ./box2dpolygon_circle

If Quasi QML plugin was not installed you need first to export QML_IMPORT_PATH
environment variable:

$ export QML_IMPORT_PATH=$(QUASI_SOURCE_TREE)/src/imports
